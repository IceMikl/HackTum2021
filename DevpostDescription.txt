## Inspiration
Problem statement shows us that Machine Learning can help to solve a problem
of temperature fluctuations. The temperature fluctuations change focus of the microscope, and
it results in poor quality of images. This problem complicates the usage of confocal 4D imaging,
which is applied in:
- histopathology;
- organs and bones modelling;
- nerve cells and brain slices modelling;
- live cell cultures observation;
- and many more important research fields...
From the data we know that the temperature fluctuations can be very strong for example:
- ("source_id": MICDEV03, "sensor_name": "LKM980_Main_Temperature_Outside", "datetime": "Jan 20, 2021, 15:05:17", "sensor_value": 22.1)
  ("source_id": MICDEV03, "sensor_name": "LKM980_Main_Temperature_Outside", "datetime": "Jan 20, 2021, 16:05:47", "sensor_value": 23.3)
According to "LSM 980 with Airyscan 2" specifications the temperature fluctuations should not be stronger as 0,5 degree.

We decided to apply our knowledge in Machine Learning and Software Engineering to offer the
domain experts a tool to detect and predict temperature fluctuations to minimize their impact on the
images quality.


## What it does
Our tool "Elegance" collects the data from the sensors and creates a User Interface, where
the user can select which type of analysis or visualization he/she wants to perform. Now our tool provide
following analytics and visualization methods:
- "Interactive Visualization": visualizes the sensor's data, can filter by "Region", "Source ID",
"Sensor Name" and "Date".
- "Group Visualization": visualizes sensor's data of selected sensor type,
by one-click on "Source ID, Region" the data will be excluded from the graph,
by double-click on the selected "Source ID, Region" will stay the same.
- "Anomaly Detection": helps to find anomalies in the data.
- "Time Series Analysis":

Tool is hosted on the Azure Web App inside a Docker container. The data is also stored inside an
Azure Blob Data Lake Gen 2.


## How we built it
We used a wide range of Python Machine Learning and Data Visualization libraries, such as "plotly"
"dash", "pandas", "matplotlib", "dash_bootstrap_components", "sklearn". The tool is hosted on the Flask
server and then containerized inside a Docker container.
We follow Clean Code conventions to make code clean and understandable. The code was build inside a
GitHub repository. We created to branches: "main" and "develop". So we were able constantly to have
a working tool.
On the Azure we created Resource Group, Container Registry and Web App to save and deploy our Docker
containers. To make CI/CD automatic we created a GitHub action, which runs by push on "main", builds
a Docker container and moves it to the Azure Container Registry. On Web App the "Continuous Deployment"
is activated, so new container will be automatically deployed.


## Challenges we ran into
- Firstly, there are problems in understanding SM+SLM components interconnection.
A clear construction scheme would be helpful.
- Secondly, nobody of us had worked with Azure platform and gitHub actions before, for this reason
it took some hours until complete CI/CD flow worked properly.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We created an app with great User Interface and a wide range of analytic methods.
- We created a great list of Hypotheses, which represent possible solution for temperature
fluctuation problems. These hypotheses can be converted to the solution methods. These can be
helpful for the ZEISS team.
- We went deep inside the literature to have a better understanding of challenge domain, to get
the interconnections between system (SM and SLM) components.
- We established an automatic CI/CD Pipeline.
- Despite a rush development we followed Versioning and Clean Code conventions.
- We did not have any problems with broken product.


## What we learned
- Azure Platform was absolutely new for all of us, during the HackTum we learned some basic of
deployment and Machine Learning tools.
- We learned how to do the GitHub actions and how to connect GitHub with Azure.
- We learned a lot of theory basics in the field of microscopes measurements.
-

## What's next for Elegance
The next steps can be:
- a development of Azure ML workflow, which collect and analyze data
in real time.
- check unproved hypotheses and develop solution methods according to them.
